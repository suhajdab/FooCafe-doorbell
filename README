FooCafé doorbell

An event organizer friend of mine has a venue where entry is rather complicated.
To make his life easier, he asked if I could build him a custom doorbell, that he could put up during events and that would ring on his mobile.

Introducing the FooCafé Doorbell v1
Featuring a NodeMCU powered by LiPo, connecting to the local wifi, communicating via PubNub with a mobile app.
